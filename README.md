# CheckYourBreast

Breast self-examination (BSE) is a routine examination that should be carried out at the same time each month to physically check for any lumps or other changes. It entails two important components, i.e. looking and feeling. With this method, women should learn what is normal for them, so that they can recognise any changes immediately.
Though scientists have concluded that breast self examination is not an effective method of reducing mortality from breast cancer and the vast majority of changes found during breast self-examination are not cancerous, in many countries it may be the only alternative and women should be encouraged to be aware of what is normal breast and recognize changes in their breast, size, shape, skin and nipples as soon as possible by self-examination once in a month or two basis. Most of the breast lumps are detected when women take bath.
W.H.O says that National Cancer Control programmes should not recommend mass screening by breast self-examination and physical examinations of the breast. Rather, programmes should encourage breast awareness and early diagnosis of breast cancer, especially for women aged 40-69 years attending primary health care centres or hospitals for other reasons, by offering them clinical breast examinations.

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

### Now what?
